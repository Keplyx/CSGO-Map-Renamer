# Map Renamer [CSGO]
Map Renamer is a software made by Keplyx to help mappers in renaming their maps and all necessary files.

**It doesn't rename packed files! Be sure to rename your map before packing files into it!**



##FEATURES

- Multiplatform
- Find all files used for your map and rename them to your new map name
- Rename content of files (eg: .kv)
- Can rename a copy or overwrite original files
- You can choose which files you don't want to rename
- Easy to use

##How to run

- Linux users, run Start.sh
- Windows users, run Start.bat

**This software needs JAVA to run**, if you don't have it, [you can download it here](https://www.java.com/download)

##How to use

1. First, select your csgo folder. *eg: [steam directory]/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo*
2. Then enter your old map name without .bsp, or select it in the file browser. *eg: de_dust2*
3. Click on Find, and a list of all found files will be displayed
4. If you don't want to rename some of the files, select them and click on Do not rename selected
5. You can choose to overwrite the original file, but this is not recommended (having backups is always good)
6. Enter your new map name without .bsp. *eg: de_dust3*
7. Finally, click on Rename! If you are renaming a copy of a complex map (like de_nuke) it can take some time
